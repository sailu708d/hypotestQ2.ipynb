A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list.
They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. 
Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.

Anova ftest statistics: Analysis of varaince between more than 2 samples or columns Assume Null Hypothesis Ho as No Varaince: All samples TAT population means are same

Thus Alternate Hypothesis Ha as It has Variance: Atleast one sample TAT population mean is different
